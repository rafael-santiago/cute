# Cute

Cute is an acronym that can be undestood as ``C`` ``u``nit ``t``est ``e``ngine or
``C`` ``u``nit ``t``est ``e``kki ekki ekki ekki phtaaaang (if you are a knigth that don't say that word).

This library brings a bunch of macros in order to guide the implementation of unit tests on ``C`` projects.

## How to build it?

To build ``libcute`` the [hefesto](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/hefesto.git) usage is necessary. Being
``Hefesto`` installed in your system all you need to emit on a ``shell`` inside the cute's ``src`` subdirectory is:

``hefesto``

After a file named ``libcute.a`` which stands for the library will be generated under the path ``src/lib``.
Now just use this file and the header ``src/cute.h`` to develop your further ``unit tests``.

Maybe you should read the [documentation](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/cute/doc/README.md) before start.
